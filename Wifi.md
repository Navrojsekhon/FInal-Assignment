This image shows a simple home Wi-Fi network layout:
- The Internet comes from your service provider.
- It first connects to a Modem, which converts the incoming signal.
- The modem connects to a Router.
- The Router creates the Wi-Fi network.
- Multiple devices like computers and phones connect wirelessly to the router to access the internet.
**In short: Internet → Modem → Router → Devices.**

# **10. Conclusion**
This SOP provides a complete, standardized procedure for setting up a secure home Wi-Fi network. Following these steps ensures proper installation, protection, and reliable connectivity for all devices in the household.
